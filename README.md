**README for COVID-19 India Map Visualization Project**

# Project Overview

In response to the unprecedented challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, I initiated a personal project aimed at creating a visual representation of the impact within India. Leveraging Python, I developed an interactive map that vividly illustrates the severity of the virus across different states. The primary objective is to offer a comprehensive view of the most affected regions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the situation.

## Project Inspiration

This endeavor draws inspiration from the dynamic live dashboard crafted by Johns Hopkins University, renowned for providing real-time trends and insights into the global pandemic. My goal is to extend this awareness to a more localized level, specifically focusing on the states within India.

## Key Features

- **State-specific Visualization:** The map highlights the most affected states, offering a clear and localized perspective on the virus spread.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interactive nature of the map ensures accessibility for a wide audience, including my parents, relatives, and friends.

- **Promoting Precautions:** By sharing this visualization, I intend to contribute to public awareness, encouraging responsible actions and necessary precautions.
